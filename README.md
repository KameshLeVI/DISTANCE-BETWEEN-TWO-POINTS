# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: Create a python program to find the distance between two points.
### Step 2:
get the co-ordinate
### Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula
### Step 4:
Display the output.
### Step 5:
End the program

### PROGRAM:
```python

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
### OUTPUT:
